## Instructions

Your challenge is to change the color of all anchor elements that fulfil the following criteria:

    The anchor is part of an unordered list
    The anchor has a class called listRight
    The anchor is a child of an element which has a class called container

The anchor element should change to the color red when a user hovers over it. Use the nesting and the & selector to achieve this effect.

Use boilerplate files. The elements you want to target are included in the [index.html](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/scss_challenges/blob/eeabdd6980e61c8e2fe2cd9bfc07a4383ea85f5b/challenge%204/index.html) file.
